Hello! This is Saranya. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I finished my under graduation in Mechanical Engineering in 2019 and after that I joined Cognizant as a Database Developer. I worked for a New York based Health insurance client where I was responsible for designing and maintaining Oracle databases using SQL, PL/SQL and C# programming language. Thereafter, I switched gears and moved to Data Engineering team where I primarily worked on a migration project which involved migrating data from traditional RDBMS to Hive tables. Outside of work, you can find me  travelling and playing basketball.
